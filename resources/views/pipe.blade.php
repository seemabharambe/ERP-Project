PIPE CLIPS
Apart from Hose Clamps, we have also developed various designs of pipe retaining clips for holding elements for hoses, pipes, cables, cable harnesses, cable protection, etc. These clips are manufactured according to DIN 3016 standard.

These Clips can be used with a single screw or bolt to fix cables, pipes and hoses into position.

These clips are Electroplated using trivalent chemicals and withstands 172 to 400hrs of SST (Salt Spray life).

Clips with sleeve or coating at the pipe holding area facilitates flexible fastening & prevents penetration of band edges in the pipe / hoses / cables or the items holding the pipe. Various types of Sleeving viz. EPDM / Neoprene / Viton / PVC Heat Shrinkable Sleeving Coating are available.
